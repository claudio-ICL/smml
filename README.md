###### An application of signature-based machine learning methods in high-frequency price formation

We give an application of signature-based machine learning mathods in high-frequency price formation. 
We study [LOBSTER](https://lobsterdata.com/) datasets of NASDAQ limit order books.
We analyse the distribution of the multidimensional paths that limit order book configurations draw on the $2n$-simplex, where $n$ is the number of price levels that one considers. 
We perform hypothesis testing based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, and we assess whether the probabilistic dynamics of normalized LOB configurations (with no price variable) can distinguish between bul and bear market regimes. 
We do so by employing two techniques: one technique is the signature transformation of a multidmensional path; the second technique is  the Donsker-Varadhan representation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
